HW1

Assumptions: 

(1) Students take at least one coding class and at least one project class

(2) Each textbook is used in at least one class

(3) Each instructor teaches at least one coding class and oversee at least one project

(4) Each class has at least one instructor 

(5) A student can have different curriculums which consist of different combination of coding class and project

(6) Project parts can be bought from different suppliers. Parts from the same online supplier can be shipped in different orders, so I created an 'Order' entity 


(7) One class or project has multiple sections. Since different instructors can teach the same class. I created an entity called "Section" to differentiate the same class that are taught by different instructors. 

(8) Each coding class is taught in one coding language 

(9) If any project parts are damaged by students, the student will pay the total unit price of the damaged parts
